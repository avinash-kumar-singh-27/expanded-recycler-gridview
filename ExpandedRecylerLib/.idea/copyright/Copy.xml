Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,&#10;      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,&#10;      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly&#10;      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be&#10;      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,&#10;      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a&#10;      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the&#10;      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,&#10;      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all&#10;      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor&#10;      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.&#10;&#10;   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing&#10;      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,&#10;      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,&#10;      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this&#10;      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only&#10;      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf&#10;      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,&#10;      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability&#10;      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason&#10;      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.&#10;&#10;   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#10;&#10;   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.&#10;&#10;      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following&#10;      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets &quot;[]&quot;&#10;      replaced with your own identifying information.
